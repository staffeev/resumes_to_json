Experience
Software engineer intern	Remote, full-time
Nethermind - provides the world’s fastest .NET Ethereum Client	Jun – Oct 2021
Contributed to the implementation of the eth call module to send a transaction immediately, without creating a transaction in the blockchain. The module can be used to query the state of an internal contract, to execute validations coded into a contract, or even to test what the effect of a transaction will be without running it in real-time.
The calculation of transaction costs implemented in the eth call module helps to calculate exactly how many resources are needed to complete the transaction
Implemented automatic detection of the transaction type in the eth call namespace, which simplifies the process of sending a transaction

Highlighted projects
File-Exchange C, Bash
Develop a client-server application. To organize interaction over the network, support multiple connections, use the software interfaces (APIs) of the operating system. The server and clients communicate using a socket-based protocol. The server must support a conditionally unlimited number of clients. At all stages of interaction between the client and the server, data processing should be provided, regardless of their size. Simultaneous downloading of different fragments of the same file from several sources is implemented.
Gangster-NTFS C, Bash
Is basic application for serving NTFS file system. Gangster-NTFS is a user-space driver for working with the NTFS file system. Gangster-NTFS can read and copy files and directories from the NTFS file system to the outside and can output all connected devices to the computer.
Kabiri Java 8, PostgreSQL, Spring Framework, VueJs
A REST web application based on VueJs with user authorization to order sausage products. The Spring backend is responsible for verifying and storing data. Triggers and functions were created for the designed database to ensure data integrity. And added indexes to some tables to achieve high query performance.
BmpTools C, Bash
A simple C-based app for rotating, blurring, and mirroring, as well as a sepia filter for BMP image format.
Notebook Java 8, PostgreSQL, Spring Framework, VueJs
A REST web application based on VueJS. The Spring server part is responsible for checking and storing data.
Balloc C, Bash
Implementation of own version of malloc and free based on the memory mapping system call mmap and a linked list of chunks of arbitrary sizes. It can be viewed as a simplified version of a memory manager typical for the standard C library and shares most of its weaknesses.
MathX  Java 8
Created several utilities that can find solutions to systems of linear and nonlinear algebraic equations, Cauchy problems; integrate, approximate and interpolate functions.
TCP - Exchanger   Java 8, PostgreSQL
Client-server application with registration, authorization in ”pure” Java, the transmission of data about user objects via TCP in JSON format, and data storage in a database. Users can view all the objects which stored on the DB, but can change only their own ones.

Background
I have 11 years of experience in computer hardware engineering. The key focus were DSP algorithms
implementation win an FPGA and ASIC chips.
DSP (Digital Signal Processing) is a wide area that uses techniques from the applied math, analyses,
statistics and statistical learning to proceed signals, like radio, voice, images, in a digital form. DSP gives
theoretical and practical recipes to develop digital circuits for signal processing. ASIC is small pieces of silicon
with integrated circuits of digital logic, that we often refer as microchip. Your dishwasher controller, GPU and CPU
are ASICs. ASIC manufacturing process requires millions of $ of investment, so there’s an option to assemble
custom digital circuit from predefined building blocks “in-filed”. FPGA (Filed Programmable Gate Array) is kind of
a LEGO blocks set, from which an engineer may assemble digital circuits “in the field” by reconfiguring the
firmware of the FPGA chip. FPGA and ASIC are consist of IP(Intellectual Property) Cores, sort of the functional
block.

Опыт работы 
Data Scientist/ML Engineer 
Июнь 2022 - Июнь 2023 
AXALIT 
• Разработал пайплайн на sklearn/pytorch/optuna, классифицирующий химические составы в камне для 
горнодобывающей промышленности. Модель обрабатывала трехмерный тензор спектральных отсчетов. 
Имплементировал модель в AXALIT. Точность модели составила 0.89 по метрике kappa. Результаты 
позволили привлечь инвестиции в проект. 
• Разработка и развертывание SMP/XGBoost системы по обнаружению и классификации отходов оптического 
сепаратора WingsBee. Обучил модель семантической сегментации с метрикой IoU=0.89. Индексы 
соответствующих классов выхода модели SS поступали в модель Xgboost. Cohen Kappa=0.82. Cистема 
получила звание: ""Лучшее распознавание и анализ отходов!""на выставке Иннопром (Главная 
промышленная выставка страны). 
• Разработал систему по object detection поврежденного тросса на базе YOLOv5. Внедрил квантизированный 
пайплайн в процессор дрона, с последующим съемом данных с местного жесткого диска и максимизации 
метрик до IoU=0,892. Это привело к снижению расходов заказчика на 12.8%. 
• Классификация овальнообразных металлов с микроскопа. Организовал детектор контуров на OpenCV-java. 
Из-за недостатка данных, синтезировал их самостоятельно на Opencv-python. Обучил 3-слойную CNN. 
• Детекция и расчет псевдодиаметров овальнообразного пресса на базе Grabcut OpenCV. 
Репетитор по теории связи 
Октябрь 2020 - Апрель 2022 
Profi 
• 3 моих учеников сдали экзамен по цифровой обработке сигналов на отлично. 1 ученик сдал курсовую на тему 
оптимальной линейной фильтрации. 2 Также 1 ученик сдал на отлично диплом на тему “Методы борьбы с 
межсимвольной интерференцией на основе оптимального H-infinity управления.” 
• 2 ученика сдали курсовые работы на тему линейных моделей в ML на 5. 
В рамках потенциального стартапа 
Февраль 2023 - Август 2023 
 
• Разрабатывал модели по прогнозированию движения актива на базе скрытых моделей Маркова, 
AR/аналогов AR, deep learning и classic ML. Но как Джим Саймонс пока не разбогател:) 
• Исследовал методологию mean reversion trading на базе процессов Орнштейна-Уленбека, AR(1) процессов, 
Калмановской фильтрации и OLS

EXPERIENCE 
Chatex (a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency marketplace) 
Feb 2020 – Present 
As a golang developer: 
• Decreased number of questions and requests from the support team to the developers by 95% by developing 
an administration tool. 
• Created a RabbitMQ consumer that receives data from various parts of the product, enriches, groups 
events in batches, and sends to several resources (Google Analytics, etc.) for further analysis. 
• Introduced and developed a mechanism of A/B test integration. Thanks to this development, we have 
tested new hypotheses and increased the conversion of successful registration by 8%. 
• Wrote a specification for our public API. Added and implemented logic for new endpoints and maintained 
the old ones. 
• Reduced the 95 percentile response time of several API methods by 2.5 times by optimizing the code and 
removing redundant remote procedure calls. 
 
PERSONAL PROJECTS 
BDayTracker [Go, Kotlin] 
A Telegram bot that reminds you about your friends’ birthdays. Users can add new friends manually or ask 
the bot to parse the information from VK — the largest CIS-oriented social network. At first, I implemented 
it in Kotlin, but then rewrote it in Go. On average, the bot sends reminders to nearly 90 users every day. 
DocumentConverter [Python] 
It’s a simple web application that can convert documents from one format to another (e.g., DOCX to PDF). 
I used Flask (Python framework) to develop it. My fellow students use it regularly for our studies.
